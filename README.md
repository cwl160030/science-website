Website for Chance Lander. Originally, following the format of cplmakerlab simple-website-template. 
The website has since deviated from the original template format.

Github pages assumes you will use jekyll. This causes GHP to render markdown files like
the README.md. The solution is to create a .nojekyll file, which prevents this behavior.
Now GPH should only render static html.
